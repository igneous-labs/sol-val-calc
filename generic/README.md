# sanctum-svc-generic

Defines common behaviours of generic sol value calculator programs. These programs:

- Have a single `pda("state")` program account that:
  - Records the last upgrade slot of the stake pool program
  - Records the sol value calculator program's manager
- Have the same interfaces for all instructions (both the SOL value calculator interface and admin-facing instructions)
